## Feature Details

### Anti-Nuke Protection
Prevent malicious users from destroying your server

#### How It Works
Anti-Nuke protection monitors your server for suspicious activities like mass channel or role deletions, creations, name changes, and server setting modifications. When someone tries to "nuke" your server or make unauthorized changes, the bot will automatically detect this behavior, take action against the offender, and revert any unauthorized changes.

#### Key Features
- Monitors channel and role deletions, creations, and name changes
- Protects against server name and icon/banner changes
- Automatically reverts unauthorized changes
- Monitors mass bans and webhook creations
- Configurable thresholds to determine what counts as suspicious activity
- Customizable punishments (ban, kick, or mute)
- Automatic logging of all detected nuke attempts
- Whitelist system for trusted admins

#### Configuration
Use the `/antinuke-config` command to view and modify your Anti-Nuke settings:

- Enable/Disable: `/antinuke-config enabled:true`
- Channel Delete Threshold: `/antinuke-config channel_delete_threshold:3`
- Role Delete Threshold: `/antinuke-config role_delete_threshold:3`
- Channel Create Threshold: `/antinuke-config channel_create_threshold:3`
- Role Create Threshold: `/antinuke-config role_create_threshold:3`
- Name Change Threshold: `/antinuke-config name_change_threshold:3`
- Punishment: `/antinuke-config punishment:ban`

üí° Need help with anti-nuke setup? Use `/nuke-help` for a detailed guide.

### Anti-Raid Protection
Stop coordinated attacks on your server

#### How It Works
Anti-Raid protection monitors the rate at which new users join your server. If too many users join in a short period of time, the bot will activate raid mode and take action against new joins to prevent the raid from continuing.

#### Key Features
- Monitors join patterns to detect coordinated raids
- Automatic raid mode activation when suspicious join activity is detected
- Manual raid mode toggle for when you anticipate or suspect a raid
- Configurable join rate thresholds and time windows
- Customizable punishments for raiders (ban, kick, or mute)

#### Configuration
Use the `/antiraid-config` command to view and modify your Anti-Raid settings:

- Enable/Disable: `/antiraid-config enabled:true`
- Join Rate Threshold: `/antiraid-config join_rate:5`
- Time Window (seconds): `/antiraid-config time_window:10`
- Punishment: `/antiraid-config punishment:kick`

#### Manual Raid Mode
You can manually activate or deactivate raid mode with the `/raid-mode` command:

- Activate Raid Mode: `/raid-mode action:activate`
- Deactivate Raid Mode: `/raid-mode action:deactivate`

üí° Need help with anti-raid setup? Use `/raid-help` for a detailed guide.

### Anti-Spam Protection
Keep your channels clean and readable

#### How It Works
Anti-Spam protection monitors the rate at which users send messages and the number of mentions in those messages. If a user sends too many messages too quickly or includes too many mentions, the bot will take action to prevent spam and automatically delete the spam messages.

#### Key Features
- Message rate monitoring to prevent rapid-fire spam
- Mass mention detection to prevent ping spam
- Automatic deletion of spam messages
- Warning system for first-time offenders
- Configurable thresholds and time windows
- Customizable punishments (ban, kick, or mute)

#### Configuration
Use the `/antispam-config` command to view and modify your Anti-Spam settings:

- Enable/Disable: `/antispam-config enabled:true`
- Message Threshold: `/antispam-config message_threshold:5`
- Time Window (seconds): `/antispam-config time_window:3`
- Punishment: `/antispam-config punishment:mute`
- Mute Duration (minutes): `/antispam-config mute_duration:10`

#### Anti-Mass-Mention Configuration
Use the `/antimention-config` command to configure mass mention protection:

- Enable/Disable: `/antimention-config enabled:true`
- Mention Threshold: `/antimention-config mention_threshold:5`
- Punishment: `/antimention-config punishment:mute`
- Mute Duration (minutes): `/antimention-config mute_duration:5`

üí° Need help with anti-spam setup? Use `/spam-help` for a detailed guide.

### Server Lockdown
Emergency protection for critical situations

#### How It Works
Server Lockdown allows you to quickly lock all channels in your server, preventing anyone from sending messages. This is useful during raids, spam attacks, or any other emergency situation where you need to quickly regain control of your server.

#### Key Features
- One command to lock all channels
- One command to unlock all channels
- Custom reason for audit logs
- Automatic logging of lockdown events

#### Using Lockdown
Use the `/lockdown` command to enable or disable server lockdown:

- Enable Lockdown: `/lockdown action:enable reason:Raid in progress`
- Disable Lockdown: `/lockdown action:disable reason:Situation resolved`

‚ÑπÔ∏è Only server owners and whitelisted users can use the lockdown command.

### Enhanced Logging
Keep track of everything happening in your server

#### How It Works
Enhanced Logging provides detailed logs of all security events and server activities. This helps you keep track of what's happening in your server and investigate any security incidents.

#### What Gets Logged
- Security events (nuke attempts, raids, spam)
- Member joins and leaves
- Message edits and deletions
- Channel and role creations, deletions, and name changes
- Server name and icon changes
- Member bans and unbans
- Server setting changes
- Voice channel activity

#### Setting Up Logging
Use the `/setup-logging` command to configure your logging channel:

- Set Logging Channel: `/setup-logging #security-logs`

‚ÑπÔ∏è It's recommended to create a private channel for logs that only moderators can access.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Setting up logging is REQUIRED for all protection features to work properly!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why aren't the protection features working?
All protection features require proper setup before they'll activate. Make sure you've:
1. Set up logging with `/setup-logging #channel`
2. Added at least one admin to the whitelist with `/whitelist add @Admin`
3. Enabled the specific protection feature (e.g., `/antinuke-config enabled:true`)

Use `/protection-status` to check which features are ready and which need more setup.

### Who can configure the bot?
By default, only the server owner can configure the bot. The server owner can add trusted admins to the whitelist using the `/whitelist add @User` command, which will allow them to configure the bot as well.

### What permissions does the bot need?
Anti Nuke Bot needs the following permissions to function properly:
- Administrator - To ensure the bot does not encounter any permission errors.
- View Channels - To monitor server activity
- Manage Channels - To lock channels during lockdown
- Kick Members - To remove raiders and spammers
- Ban Members - To ban users who attempt to nuke the server
- Manage Roles - To apply mutes and manage permissions
- View Audit Log - To detect nuke attempts and other malicious actions
- Send Messages - To send warnings and notifications
- Manage Messages - To delete spam messages
- Read Message History - For logging and monitoring

Additionally, the bot's role should be positioned at the top of your server's role list to ensure it can manage all roles.

### Will the bot punish server admins?
No, the bot will not punish the server owner or any users on the whitelist. This ensures that trusted admins can perform administrative actions without triggering the bot's protection measures.

### What should I do if my server is being raided?
If your server is being raided, you should:
1. Activate raid mode with `/raid-mode action:activate`
2. Enable server lockdown with `/lockdown action:enable reason:Raid in progress`
3. Wait for the raid to subside
4. Disable lockdown with `/lockdown action:disable reason:Raid over`
5. Deactivate raid mode with `/raid-mode action:deactivate`

### How do I fix common errors?
The bot includes a comprehensive error troubleshooting system. Use the `/errors` command to access an interactive guide for fixing common issues. This includes solutions for:
- Bot permission problems
- Setup and configuration issues
- Protection features not working
- Command errors
- And more

You can also use specific help commands like `/nuke-help`, `/spam-help`, etc., for feature-specific guidance.

### Can I use the bot on multiple servers?
Yes, Anti Nuke Bot can be used on multiple servers simultaneously. Each server has its own independent configuration, so you can customize the bot differently for each server based on their specific needs.

### How do I report bugs or suggest features?
You can report bugs or suggest features by joining our support server. Click the "Join Support Server" button in the Support section below to get help from our team and community.

### Is there a premium version of the bot?
Right now, all of Anti Nuke Bot's main security features are completely free, and that's how we plan to keep it. We do offer two premium extras: File Scanning and Custom Bot Instances, which help support development. But everything you need to protect your server is free and ready to use. Keeping your community safe shouldn't come with a price tag.
