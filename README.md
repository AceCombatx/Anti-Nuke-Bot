🛡️ **Welcome to Anti-Nuke Bot**  

Your automated guardian against nukes, raids, spam, and malicious behavior.  
All within Discord.

  


💡 **What is Anti-Nuke Bot?**

Anti-Nuke Bot is a next-gen Discord protection bot built to shield your server from dangerous exploits, mass destruction attacks, and disruptive users.  

It works silently behind the scenes to stop nukes, prevent raids, block spam, and maintain order so you don’t have to lift a finger.  

From intelligent threat detection to customizable punishments and detailed logs, Anti-Nuke Bot is your all-in-one defense system.

  


🚀 **Key Protection Modules**

🔹 **Anti-Nuke**  
Detects and stops mass bans, role deletions, channel nukes, and webhook abuse.  
Automatically punishes the attacker before the damage spreads.

  

🔹 **Anti-Raid**  
Monitors rapid member joins and activates raid mode if thresholds are exceeded.  
Auto-kick or auto-ban attackers based on your settings.

  

🔹 **Anti-Spam & Anti-Mention**  
Prevents users from flooding your channels or ping-spamming roles and members.  
Mutes or bans offenders with configurable thresholds.

  

🔹 **Role & Channel Lockdown**  
Lock the entire server in one command during an attack.  
Automatically removes send permissions from @everyone in all channels.

  

🔹 **Logging System**  
Every action is logged in real time to a secure channel.  
Get alerts when users are banned, roles are deleted, or suspicious actions occur.

  

🔹 **Per-Server Configuration**  
Each server has its own settings. Fully configurable with slash commands like  
`/antinuke_config`, `/antiraid_config`, and more.

  

🔹 **Whitelist System**  
Add trusted users to bypass protections.  
Perfect for staff, bots, and automation tools.

  

🔹 **Smart Punishment Engine**  
Choose what happens: mute, kick, or ban.  
Customize thresholds and duration for each type of threat.
